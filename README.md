# CMPG-323-Project-3---34486844
 Project 3, focuses on enhancing an existing ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application. The project emphasizes architectural insights, coding principles, and design patterns to elevate skills. The aim is to refine functionality, delve into code intricacies, and create a more efficient web app.

# Branching Strategy
I will use a version control strategy for tis project in order to efficiently manage the projects development process. This approach guarantees the main repository's stability while allowing me to work on new features and fixes at the same time.The brances will work as follows.
Master: The stable version of the project will always be found in the master branch. It displays the current level of production readiness. Develop: The branch that will be used for continuous development will be develop branch, it will act as the integration branch. Before being merged into the master branch, it serves as the integration point for new features, bug fixes, and other improvements. 
Feature: Specific features or tasks will have their own feature branches. The develop branch gives rise to multiple feature branches, each of which focuses on a different feature. The feature will be finished and then merged back into the develop branch.
